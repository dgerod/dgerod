### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer engineer specialized in Robotics, a generalist roboticist. My main expertise areas are: (1) Development of Software Systems, and (2) Robotics and Intelligent Systems.

In [my scratchpad](https://dgerod.github.io) I write quick notes about things that I see during while I am working and could be interesting for other people. The lastest notes are:
